Repo to organize RAM Legacy Updates and new research around shark stocks

Repo includes all major tuna, billfish, and shark stocks managed by the primary RFMOs 

"code" folder includes several markdown documents, one for each rfmo extracting existing RAM data to use in updated figures. Markdown files with "catch" in the title are used to generate total catch by taxonomy group (tuna, billfish, and shark).

"data" folder includes data downloads directly from RAM (files with "timeseries" in the name) as well as updated files on catch (all files with "catch" in the name). These are organized by the stockid codes used by RAM.
